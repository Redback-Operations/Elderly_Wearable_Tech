ALZEHEIMER"S DISEASE 

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. The disease involves a buildup of proteins in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. There is no cure, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

Aim

The main objective our model is to predict the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease using a combination of clinical assessments, neuroimaging data, and demographic information. By accurately identifying individuals at risk and monitoring the progression of the disease.

Dataset Description 

The dataset includes clinical assessments, neuroimaging data, and demographic information. Key features include cognitive status, MRI scans, age, education level, and cognitive test scores.

Prediction Models

Several machine learning models were used to predict Alzheimer's disease status

Prediction Model 1 contaions

1. Decision Tree: 88% accuracy
2. Random Forest: 91% accuracy
3. ADA Boost: 89% accuracy

Prediction Model 2 contains

1. K-Means Clustering: 88% accuracy
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): 88% accuracy
3. Logistic Regression: 89.3% accuracy
