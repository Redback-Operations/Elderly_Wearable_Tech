# Research into future potential features

A componant of this feature was to look into potential Glucose Monitoring options for the sensor.

Technical research would show that this can fall into two categories - active glucose monitoring, with integration of glucose monitoring to the sensor, and active glucose montioring, where the glucose monitor is connected to a dashboard or alternative device that pushes alerts to the user.

Current possible types of Glucose Monitoring:
Glucose monitoring
- Flash Glucose - continuous montior [^1]
- Glucose Monitoring - finger prick [^2] 
- Wearable Sweat-Glucose Sensors[^3][^4][^5] 

Why continuous monitoring?  Why would this be important?
A lot of things affect blood glucose, including (but not limited to):
- Food
- Exercise
- Illness
- Medication
- Alcohol
- Stress
- Environment
- How you check your blood glucose

Continuous monitoring would enable real time checking, and would ensure better outcomes for the patient.

Limitation, however, are that this can not be currently integrated into the sensor; but could be integrated into the dashboard (when it is made), and then enable push notifications to the sensor for alerts. 

There are currently different apps (eg - [^6], [^7]) that would enable integration potentially in the furture.

Of note; this is medical data, so would require appropriate assessment of options in order to integrate.

Standard finger prick, with recording of data to the dashboard is also an option; this could be done manually, with the user inputting their values each day, and then track progression.

There are also multiple testing pertaining to wearable sweat-glucose monitoring; this is still in early stages, but could be an option for later iterations.

Prediabetes vs Diabetes.

Why look at prediabetes?  Why not just diabetes? 
- Prediabetes and Diabetes
Preventing diabetes is best, and by predicting it when it is at the prediabetes stage, means that you can potentially reverse it, prior to it becoming diabetes.  This leads to better health outcomes overall [^8],[^9],[^10],[^11],[^12],[^13],[^14],[^15].

Dashboard
- If the dashboard is able to not only record data, but share and push advice and alerts to the person, this would enable 

Alerts
Potential for an alert when:
 - Blood glucose is too high / low
 - Time to check blood glucose
 - Time to take insulin, food, or medication
 - Alerts for how the person is

Definitions and glossary of terms:
For further info, refer to the GLUCOSEMONITORINGRESEARCH.md file
- Blood Glucose Level (BGL) 
- Blood Glucose - level of glucose in your blood.
- HbA1c (also known as 'glycated heamoglobin).  Does not require fasting or prep; tests the amount of glycated haemoglobin.
- Fasting - inital blood glucose level taken, after not eating for 12 hours prior (generally)
- 2 hr glucose - blood glucose level taken at 2hrs after fasting, after having consumed a specificied glucose solution. 
- Random - Random time blood test.
- Oral glucose tolerance test - a test where a patient fasts for 
- Target Range - the specified BGL target range
- Time in Target - time BGL is in target range
- Finger prick - device to piece finger (lancet) to extract blood drop
- Flash Glucose - continuous blood glucose monitor that reads and transmits continuously
- Glucose monitor - can be used to take blood glucose from a finger prick and strip, singular reading per strip, not continuous
- Hypoglycaemia (also known as 'hypos') - BGL below 4mmol/L
- Hyperglycaemia - BGL above 15mmol/L
