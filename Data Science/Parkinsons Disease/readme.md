# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Tagline: 
 Gait Analysis of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Patients and Control Objects to identify differences using data from Phisonet’s Gaitpdb database.

## Description:
This project involves analyzing gait data to detect Parkinson’s Disease. It uses data from the Phisonet’s Gaitpdb database, where 8 sensors are applied to each foot of the subjects to calculate the Vertical Ground Reaction Forces (VGRF). Data compression is achieved using 7 statistical functions to reduce over 3 million tuples into 310 tuples, providing a representative image of the data. The dataset is took from a public repository. https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/

The combined dataset is in the following drive links:
